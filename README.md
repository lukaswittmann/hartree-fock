# hartree-fock
The Hartree-Fock algorithm, a method for approximating the wave function and energy of a quantum many-body system by assuming that the exact N-body wave function of the system can be adequately described by a single Slater determinant. The goal of this project is to implement the HF algorithm for the H2 molecule. 
For this, only the basis set (currently 6-31G) and coordinates were used as input. All integrals for the SCF algorithm are all calculated explicitly.
Since I started the project to understand the Hartree-Fock algorithm in more detail, I tried to make the code very readable and didactically useful.
If there are any suggestions for improvement or fixes to my code, please let me know.
